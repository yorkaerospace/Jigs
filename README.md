# Generic Rocket Jigs

This is a collection of [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) files used to generate parameterised jigs for our rocket designs.

### Usage

Get the files for the jigs you want (download or clone).
Either [`include`/`use`](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Include_Statement) them in other files or edit their examples to fit your needs, then use OpenSCAD to render them.
